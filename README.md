# Friendly Frontend Prototype Boilerplate
This project aims to provide boilerplate for rapid prototyping of html components.

This is very much a work in progress. Don't expect it not to blow up.

## The goal
To have a prototype boilerplate that is easy to set up and quick to get started with, 
* You are in control of the build tooling. Don't like it? It's a boilerplate! Fork and change!
* You are in control of the tech stack. Don't like it? It's a boilerplate! Fork and change!
* (not quite working) Provide a preview to visit on both your desktop and handheld at the same time. See the relevant changes as they happen in real time. 


## Current tech stack
* laravel-mix
* webpack
* browser-sync
* babel
* node-sass
* pug (jade)
